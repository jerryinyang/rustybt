## [2025-10-17 12:04:27] - Mandatory Pre-Flight Checklists Implementation

**Focus Area:** Documentation (Sprint Debugging Process)

---

### ⚠️ MANDATORY PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST

**Issues Found:**
1. No mandatory pre-flight process for sprint debugging fixes - `docs/internal/sprint-debug/fixes.md`
2. Risk of repeating Epic 10 quality issues without systematic checks
3. No framework code update checklist equivalent to documentation checklist

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Why did this issue occur: Initial sprint-debug setup focused on tracking but not prevention
- What pattern should prevent recurrence: Mandatory pre-flight checklists before all fixes ensure quality gates

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Embedded mandatory pre-flight checklists in fixes.md template** - `docs/internal/sprint-debug/fixes.md`
   - Added Documentation Updates pre-flight checklist (adapted from Story 11.4)
   - Added Framework Code Updates pre-flight checklist (based on coding standards)
   - Made checklists part of batch template (can't skip)
   - Added root cause analysis requirement to template

2. **Updated sprint-debug workflow in README** - `docs/internal/sprint-debug/README.md`
   - Added Step 2: Mandatory Pre-Flight Checklist
   - Documented both checklist types with key points
   - Updated verification checklist to include pre-flight completion
   - Renumbered subsequent workflow steps

**Tests Added/Modified:**
- N/A (documentation-only change)

**Issues Found:**
1. Notebook names not clickable in `docs/examples/notebooks/README.md` - lines 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 71, 76
2. User reported inability to open notebooks directly from documentation
3. Plain text notebook names instead of markdown links reduces usability

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Why did this issue occur: Documentation created with plain text file names instead of markdown links
- What pattern should prevent recurrence: Always verify documentation links are clickable during creation, include link check in pre-flight checklist

**Fixes Applied:**
1. **Converted all 13 notebook names to clickable markdown links** - `docs/examples/notebooks/README.md`
   - Changed format from `**filename.ipynb**` to `[**filename.ipynb**](filename.ipynb)`
   - Applied to all notebooks: crypto_backtest_ccxt, equity_backtest_yfinance, 01-11 notebooks
   - Links are relative (same directory), so they work in both GitHub and MkDocs
   - Preserved all formatting (bold text, numbering, descriptions)

**Tests Added/Modified:**
- N/A (documentation-only change)

**Documentation Updated:**
- `docs/examples/notebooks/README.md` - Converted 13 notebook names to clickable links (lines 10, 16, 22, 28, 34, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 71, 76)

**Verification:**
- [x] All tests pass (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Linting passes (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Type checking passes (N/A - no code changes)
- [x] Black formatting check passes (N/A - no code changes)
