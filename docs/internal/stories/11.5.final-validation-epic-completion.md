## Risk and Mitigation

### Primary Risk: Discovering Issues During Final Validation
**Impact**: MEDIUM (could delay completion)
**Mitigation**:
- Each story already validated independently
- Final validation is additional check
- Most issues should have been caught earlier
- Budget time for addressing findings

**Rollback Trigger Assessment**:
- Minor issues: Address and continue
- Critical issues: Assess against Epic 11 Rollback Plan (see below)

### Secondary Risk: User Feedback Requires Changes
**Impact**: MEDIUM (could delay acceptance)
**Mitigation**:
- User involved throughout Epic 11
- No surprises in final review
- Critical feedback addressed immediately
- Non-critical feedback documented for future

**Rollback Trigger Assessment**:
- Minor feedback: Address and continue
- Critical quality issues: Assess against Epic 11 Rollback Plan

### Epic 11 Rollback Plan Reference (NEW)

**When to Consider Rollback**:
Per Epic 11 (lines 861-911), consider rollback if:
1. Time investment exceeds 150% of high estimate (>222 hours)
2. Framework expert availability becomes permanent blocker
3. Major framework design issues require code changes
4. User decides cost-benefit doesn't justify redo

**Rollback Procedure** (if needed):
1. Restore archived documentation from `docs/_archive/v1-epic10-2025-10-15/`
2. Preserve quality framework (keep standards, checklists, automation)
3. Fallback to incremental improvements (hybrid approach)
4. Document lessons learned

**Decision Authority**: User (Project Owner) + PM Agent

**Story 11.5 Responsibility**:
- If critical issues discovered during final validation, present options to user:
  - Option A: Address issues and continue (estimated time: ___)
  - Option B: Execute rollback plan
- Document decision and rationale

---

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites**:
- **Story 11.1 MUST be complete**
- **Story 11.2 MUST be complete**
- **Story 11.3 MUST be complete**
- **Story 11.4 MUST be complete**

**Critical Path**: This is the final story blocking Epic 11 completion

**Related**:
- All Epic 11 stories
