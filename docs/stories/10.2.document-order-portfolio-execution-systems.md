### Priority Order:
1. Expand order types documentation first (builds on existing)
2. Document execution and transaction costs (core functionality)
3. Document portfolio management (essential for strategies)
4. Document multi-strategy and risk (advanced features)

### Documentation Standards:
- Include warnings for risk-related features
- Provide realistic trading examples
- Explain financial concepts clearly
- Show both simple and advanced usage patterns

### Testing

**Test Approach:**
- **Framework:** pytest with doctest integration
- **Location:** Documentation examples validated in-place via doctest
- **Test Execution:** Run `pytest --doctest-modules docs/api/order-management/ docs/api/portfolio-management/`
- **Standards:** All code examples must be executable and demonstrate realistic trading scenarios

**Coverage Validation:**
- Use Python introspection to identify all public APIs in finance/portfolio packages
- Measure documentation coverage: documented APIs / total public APIs ≥ 90%
- Generate coverage report for order, execution, and portfolio modules

**Specific Testing Requirements for this Story:**
- Validate all order type examples create valid order objects
- Test execution simulation examples complete without errors
- Verify transaction cost calculations return expected types
- Ensure portfolio tracking examples maintain proper state
- Test multi-strategy allocation examples with realistic parameters
- Validate risk management examples trigger appropriate limits

**Risk-Specific Validation:**

- Test that dangerous operations (e.g., leverage) have explicit warnings
- Ensure cost model examples show realistic fee structures
- Validate P&L calculation examples use correct accounting methods

**Example Validation Checklist:**
