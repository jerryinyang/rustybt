# Story 5.1: Design Optimization Framework Architecture

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** architectural design for optimization framework with pluggable search algorithms,
**so that** implementation follows cohesive design with clear separation of concerns.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Architecture diagram showing Optimizer, SearchAlgorithm interface, ParameterSpace, ObjectiveFunction
2. Interface contracts defined for SearchAlgorithm base class (required methods: suggest, update, is_complete)
3. ParameterSpace design (support continuous, discrete, categorical parameters)
4. Parallel execution architecture designed (Ray for distributed, multiprocessing for local)
5. Result storage design (optimization history, parameter→result mapping, best parameters tracking)
6. Checkpoint/resume support designed (save/restore optimization progress)
7. Integration with backtest engine defined (how optimization runs backtests with different parameters)
8. Architecture documentation saved to docs/architecture/optimization.md
9. Design reviewed for extensibility (easy to add new search algorithms)
10. Design approved before implementation begins

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous Epic 5 stories exist. This is the first story establishing the optimization framework foundation.

### Tech Stack References
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md)]
- **Property Testing**: hypothesis 6.x+ for validation
- **Optimization Libraries**:
  - scikit-optimize (skopt) for Bayesian optimization
  - DEAP for genetic algorithms
  - scipy for optimization utilities
- **Parallel Processing**:
  - multiprocessing (stdlib) for local parallelization
  - Ray (optional) for distributed optimization
- **Data Storage**: Parquet for optimization results (via pyarrow)
- **Validation**: pydantic 2.x+ for parameter space validation

```

### Data Models and Validation
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#L42)]
- Use **pydantic 2.x+** for parameter space validation and configuration
- Define dataclasses for ParameterSpace, OptimizationResult, SearchAlgorithm config
- Use type hints extensively for all interfaces

### Integration with Backtest Engine
The optimization framework must integrate with the existing TradingAlgorithm backtest engine:
- Load strategy with different parameter sets
- Execute backtest via `run_algorithm()` API
- Extract objective metrics from backtest results (Sharpe ratio, total return, etc.)
- Handle backtest failures gracefully (invalid parameters, data issues)

### Parallel Processing Strategy
[Source: [tech-stack.md](docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#L40)]
- **Local**: Use `multiprocessing` module for CPU-bound parallel backtests
- **Distributed** (Optional): Use Ray for scaling across multiple machines
- Design must support both modes with minimal code changes
- Thread-safe result aggregation required

### Performance Considerations
- Optimization runs will execute many backtests (100s to 1000s)
- Each backtest is CPU-intensive
- Parallel execution essential for reasonable completion times
- Checkpoint/resume support critical for long-running optimizations

### Checkpoint/Resume Design Strategy
[Source: AC 6]
**Architecture Decision**: Separate concerns between SearchAlgorithm state and persistence:

**SearchAlgorithm Responsibility** (Stories 5.2-5.5):
- Maintain serializable internal state (population, history, counters, etc.)
- Implement state getters/setters for persistence
- Focus on algorithm logic, not file I/O

**Optimizer Wrapper Responsibility** (This story):
- Handle checkpoint file creation/management
- Serialize/deserialize SearchAlgorithm state
- Support checkpoint frequency configuration (every N iterations, time-based)
- Provide resume functionality (detect checkpoint, load state, continue)

**Benefits**:
- Keeps algorithm implementations simple and focused
- Consistent checkpoint format across all algorithms
- Easy to add new algorithms (just maintain state, don't handle persistence)
- Centralized error handling for file operations

### Extensibility Requirements
[Source: AC 9]
New search algorithms must be easy to add:
- Implement SearchAlgorithm abstract base class
- Register with Optimizer
- No changes to core Optimizer logic required

### Architecture Documentation Location
[Source: AC 8]
Documentation must be saved to: `docs/architecture/optimization.md`

### Design Approval Process
[Source: AC 10]
- Create architecture document with diagrams
- Submit for review to senior developer
- Address feedback
- Get explicit approval before Stories 5.2-5.10 begin

### Testing

#### Test File Location
[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L441-L444)]
- Tests mirror source structure: `tests/optimization/test_optimizer.py`
- Test naming: `test_<module>.py`
- Test functions: `test_<function_name>_<scenario>`

#### Testing Standards
[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L3-L7)]
- **Overall Coverage**: ≥90%
- **New Components**: ≥90% strict enforcement
- This is a design story, so testing focuses on validating design decisions through proof-of-concept code

#### Test Types for Design Validation
[Source: [testing-strategy.md](docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md#L11-L24)]
- **Unit Tests**: Validate interface contracts and core abstractions
- **Integration Tests**: Validate backtest engine integration with sample optimization
- **Property Tests**: Validate parameter space invariants

#### No Mocking Allowed
[Source: [coding-standards.md](docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#L137-L212)]
- **Zero-Mock Enforcement**: All tests must exercise real functionality
- No hardcoded return values in validation functions
- All validations must perform actual checks
- Design validation tests should run simple but real optimizations
