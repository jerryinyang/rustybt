# Story 6.1: Design Live Trading Engine Architecture

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** architectural design for event-driven live trading engine,
**so that** implementation follows production-ready patterns with clear concurrency and error handling strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Architecture diagram showing EventLoop, OrderManager, DataFeed, BrokerAdapter, StateManager, Scheduler
2. Async/await design specified (asyncio for I/O-bound operations, threading for CPU-bound)
3. Event types defined (MarketData, OrderFill, OrderReject, ScheduledTrigger, SystemError)
4. State persistence design (what to save: strategy state, positions, orders, cash)
5. Crash recovery design (restore from last checkpoint, reconcile with broker)
6. Threading/concurrency model documented (avoid race conditions, use thread-safe queues)
7. Error handling strategy defined (retry logic, circuit breakers, graceful degradation)
8. Monitoring and alerting hooks designed (emit events for external monitoring)
9. Architecture documentation saved to docs/architecture/live-trading.md
10. Design reviewed for production readiness before implementation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 6, building on the foundation established in Epics 1-5:
- Epic 1: Decimal precision finance layer (DecimalLedger, DecimalPosition)
- Epic 2: Polars/Parquet data layer (PolarsDataPortal, data adapters)
- Epic 3: Advanced backtesting features (multi-strategy, partial fills, advanced orders)
- Epic 4: Comprehensive testing and documentation
- Epic 5: Strategy optimization framework

Epic 6 adds live trading capabilities on top of this proven backtesting foundation.

### Architecture Context

**Tech Stack Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#new-technology-additions-rustybt-enhancements]
- **Async Framework:** asyncio (stdlib) for I/O-bound broker API calls and live data feeds
- **Scheduling:** APScheduler 3.x+ for market open/close triggers and custom intervals
- **WebSocket:** websockets 14.x+ for real-time data streaming
- **Validation:** pydantic 2.x+ for event data validation and config management
- **Decimal:** Python Decimal (stdlib) for all financial calculations
- **DataFrames:** Polars 1.x for data operations
- **Broker Libraries:** ccxt 4.x+, ib_async 1.x+, binance-connector 3.x+, pybit 5.x+, hyperliquid-python-sdk

**Component Architecture Patterns:**
[Source: architecture/component-architecture.md#live-trading-components]
- LiveTradingEngine: Main orchestrator with async event loop, broker integration, state management
- BrokerAdapter: Abstract base class with async interface (connect, submit_order, cancel_order, get_positions, get_account_info, subscribe_market_data, get_next_event)
- Adapter Implementations: CCXTAdapter, IBAdapter, BinanceAdapter, BybitAdapter, HyperliquidAdapter, PaperBroker
- PositionReconciler: Compare local state vs broker positions, handle discrepancies
- StateManager: Checkpoint strategy state, positions, orders to disk for crash recovery
- TradingScheduler: Market triggers using APScheduler (market_open, market_close, custom intervals)

**External API Integration Patterns:**
[Source: architecture/external-api-integration.md]
- Broker APIs use async/await for all operations
- Error handling with retry logic and exponential backoff
- Rate limiting per broker specifications
- Authentication via credentials dict (api_key, api_secret, etc.)
- Connection timeout: 30s, reconnection with exponential backoff
- Order status polling for confirmation

**Coding Standards:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#asyncawait]
- Use async/await for all broker API calls and I/O operations
- Event loop: asyncio (standard library)
- Structured logging with structlog (log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- Type hints required with mypy --strict compliance
- Error handling with specific exception classes (BrokerError, OrderRejectedError)
- No mock implementations allowed (Zero-Mock Enforcement)

**Error Handling Patterns:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]
- Custom exception hierarchy: RustyBTError > BrokerError > OrderRejectedError
- Always log exceptions with context using structlog
- Retry logic required for transient errors
- No silent exception swallowing (no empty except blocks)

**Concurrency Guardrails:**
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#mutation-safety]
- Immutable data structures preferred (dataclasses with frozen=True)
- Explicit Optional types for nullable values
- No mutation of input arguments in functions
- Thread-safe queues for event passing

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#rustybt-directory-structure]
- Architecture documentation: `docs/architecture/live-trading.md` **(NEW FILE - will be created in this story, AC 9)**
- Live trading engine: `rustybt/live/engine.py`
- Broker adapters: `rustybt/live/brokers/` (base.py, ccxt_adapter.py, ib_adapter.py, etc.)
- State manager: `rustybt/live/state_manager.py`
- Position reconciler: `rustybt/live/reconciler.py`
- Scheduler: `rustybt/live/scheduler.py`
- Streaming components: `rustybt/live/streaming/` (base.py, binance_stream.py)

### Project Structure Notes
This story creates architectural documentation only (no code implementation). The architecture will guide implementation in subsequent stories (6.2-6.11). The live trading engine is a new component with no Zipline equivalent, so we're designing from first principles while following RustyBT patterns.

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Location:**
- No tests required for this story (architecture documentation only)
- Subsequent implementation stories (6.2+) will require:
  - Unit tests: ≥90% coverage in `tests/live/`
  - Integration tests: Live trading workflows in `tests/integration/live/`
  - Property-based tests: Event processing invariants using Hypothesis

**Testing Standards for Future Implementation:**
- Mock broker APIs using pytest-mock or responses
- Use paper trading accounts for broker integration tests
- Validate event processing order and priority
- Test crash recovery scenarios (save → crash → restore)
- Test position reconciliation with simulated discrepancies
- Performance test: engine handles 1000+ events/second with <10ms latency
