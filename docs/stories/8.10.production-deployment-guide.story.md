# Story 8.10: Create Production Deployment Guide and Validate Readiness

## Status
Ready for development

## Story
**As a** quantitative trader,
**I want** comprehensive deployment guide and validated production readiness,
**so that** I can deploy live trading with confidence in platform reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Deployment guide covers environment setup (Python, Rust, dependencies)
2. Guide covers configuration (brokers, data sources, API keys, risk limits)
3. Guide covers security hardening (firewall, API authentication, credential encryption)
4. Guide covers monitoring setup (logs, alerts, dashboards)
5. Guide covers backup and disaster recovery (state persistence, restore procedures)
6. Production checklist provided (all items must pass before live trading)
7. 99.9% uptime validation: run paper trading for extended period, measure uptime and error rate
8. Performance validation: ensure production hardware meets performance requirements
9. Security audit: review code for vulnerabilities (use bandit, safety for Python)
10. Documentation includes troubleshooting guide for common deployment issues

### Uptime Calculation
```python
# 99.9% uptime target
uptime_pct = 0.999

# Allowed downtime per time period
downtime_per_year = (1 - uptime_pct) * 365 * 24  # 8.76 hours
downtime_per_month = (1 - uptime_pct) * 30 * 24  # 43.2 minutes
downtime_per_week = (1 - uptime_pct) * 7 * 24    # 10.08 minutes
downtime_per_day = (1 - uptime_pct) * 24         # 1.44 minutes

# Validation: run paper trading for 30 days
validation_duration_days = 30
validation_duration_hours = validation_duration_days * 24  # 720 hours
max_downtime_hours = validation_duration_hours * (1 - uptime_pct)  # 0.72 hours = 43 minutes

# If total downtime exceeds 43 minutes in 30 days, validation fails
```

### Example Deployment Guide Structure
```markdown
# RustyBT Production Deployment Guide

## 1. Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or macOS 13+
- Python 3.12+
- Rust 1.90+ (optional, for Rust optimizations)
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- 50GB disk space minimum

## 2. Installation
### Install Python 3.12
```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv

# macOS
brew install python@3.12
```

### Install uv
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Install RustyBT
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rustybt.git
cd rustybt
uv venv --python 3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[all]"
```

## 3. Configuration
### Create .env file
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

### Configure broker API keys
```bash
# Binance
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BINANCE_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here

# Encryption key (generate with: python -m rustybt keygen)
RUSTYBT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_here
```

## 4. Security Hardening
### Encrypt credentials
```bash
python -m rustybt encrypt-credentials
```

### Configure firewall
```bash
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp  # SSH
sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp  # API (if Epic 9 implemented)
sudo ufw enable
```

## 5. Run Paper Trading Validation
```bash
rustybt paper-trade --duration 30d --strategy momentum.py
```

## 6. Go Live
```bash
rustybt live-trade --strategy momentum.py --broker binance
```
```

### Testing
- Manual testing: Follow deployment guide on clean VM
- Validation: Run paper trading for 30 days, verify 99.9% uptime
- Security audit: Run bandit and safety, verify no high-severity issues

### Zero-Mock Enforcement
- Paper trading validation must run actual strategy, not mocked
- Uptime measurement must track actual system availability
- Security audit must use real tools (bandit, safety), not fake results
