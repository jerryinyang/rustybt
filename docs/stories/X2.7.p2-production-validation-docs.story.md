# Story X2.7: P2 Production Validation & Documentation

## Status
Approved for development

## Story

**As a** DevOps Engineer and Technical Writer preparing RustyBT for production launch,
**I want** all production-critical operational flows validated and documentation verified for accuracy,
**so that** I have confidence in system reliability, uptime targets are demonstrable, and deployment procedures are trustworthy and complete.

**Dependencies:**
- **Prerequisites:** Story X2.1 (security, tests operational) and Story X2.2 (clean codebase, dependencies secure) must be completed
- **Blocks:** Production deployment (validation provides go-live confidence)

**Estimated Effort:**
- Initial validation setup: 1 day
- Paper trading monitoring: 30 days (mostly automated)
- Documentation audit and fixes: 1-2 days
- Report writing: 0.5 days
- **Total: 2-3 days active work + 30-day monitoring period**

### Technical Implementation Guidance

**Operational Validation Sequence:**

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure X2.1 and X2.2 are complete (clean codebase, working tests)
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   uv sync -E test

   # Create validation environment
   export RUSTYBT_ENV=validation
   export RUSTYBT_LOG_DIR=~/.rustybt/logs/validation
   mkdir -p ~/.rustybt/logs/validation
   ```

2. **Broker Connection Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Test paper broker (no external dependencies)
   python -m rustybt test-broker --broker paper
   # Expected: Success, connection details logged

   # Test CCXT broker (requires API keys, use testnet)
   export CCXT_EXCHANGE=binance  # Or other exchange
   export CCXT_API_KEY=<testnet-key>
   export CCXT_SECRET=<testnet-secret>
   python -m rustybt test-broker --broker $CCXT_EXCHANGE --testnet
   # Expected: Success, account info retrieved

   # Document results
   echo "Broker test results:" > validation-report.md
   python -m rustybt test-broker --broker paper >> validation-report.md 2>&1
   ```

3. **Data Provider Tests:**
   ```bash
   # Test yfinance (no API key required)
   python -m rustybt test-data --source yfinance --symbol SPY --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-12-31
   # Expected: Success, data sample logged

   # Test bundle (if available)
   python -m rustybt test-data --source quandl
   # Expected: Success, bundle data validated

   # Document results
   echo "Data provider test results:" >> validation-report.md
   python -m rustybt test-data --source yfinance --symbol SPY >> validation-report.md 2>&1
   ```

4. **Benchmark Execution:**
   ```bash
   # Run backtest benchmark suite
   python -m rustybt benchmark --suite backtest --output benchmark-results.json
   # Expected: Benchmark completes, results saved

   # Review results
   cat benchmark-results.json
   # Verify: execution times reasonable, no errors

   # Document results
   echo "Benchmark results:" >> validation-report.md
   cat benchmark-results.json >> validation-report.md
   ```

5. **Paper Trading Validation (30-day or in-progress):**
   ```bash
   # Prepare strategy
   cat > simple_strategy.py <<EOF
   from rustybt import Algorithm

   class SimpleStrategy(Algorithm):
       def initialize(self, context):
           self.symbol = self.sid('SPY')

       def handle_data(self, context, data):
           # Simple moving average crossover
           if not context.portfolio.positions[self.symbol]:
               self.order(self.symbol, 100)
   EOF

   # Start paper trading
   python -m rustybt paper-trade \
     --strategy simple_strategy.py \
     --broker paper \
     --duration 30d \
     --log-level INFO
   # Expected: Trading session starts, logs to ~/.rustybt/logs/

   # Monitor logs (in separate terminal)
   tail -f ~/.rustybt/logs/paper-trade.log

   # After 30 days (or interim period), analyze uptime
   python -m rustybt analyze-uptime \
     --log-dir ~/.rustybt/logs \
     --start-date 2025-10-11 \
     --end-date 2025-11-10 \
     --output uptime-report.json

   # Document results
   echo "Paper trading results:" >> validation-report.md
   cat uptime-report.json >> validation-report.md
   ```

6. **Documentation Audit:**
   ```bash
   # Extract all CLI command references from docs
   grep -rn "python -m rustybt" docs/ > command-references.txt

   # Manually review each reference:
   # - Verify command name exists: python -m rustybt --help
   # - Verify options/flags: python -m rustybt <command> --help
   # - Test example commands

   # Document discrepancies
   echo "Documentation discrepancies:" >> validation-report.md
   # ... add findings
   ```

7. **Documentation Fixes:**
   ```bash
   # Example fix: Update incorrect command name
   sed -i 's/fetch-data/test-data/g' docs/deployment-guide.md

   # Verify fix
   grep "test-data" docs/deployment-guide.md

   # Commit fix
   git add docs/deployment-guide.md
   git commit -m "docs: Fix command reference from fetch-data to test-data"
   ```

**Existing Pattern Reference:**
- **CLI command pattern:** See `rustybt/__main__.py` for command structure
- **Configuration pattern:** See `~/.rustybt/config.yaml` for YAML structure
- **Logging pattern:** See `rustybt/utils/logging.py` for structured logging
- **Documentation pattern:** See existing docs/ files for markdown structure
- **Validation reporting:** See docs/qa/ for QA gate examples (create similar for validation report)

**Key Constraints:**
- **No production impact:** All validation uses testnet, paper trading, or isolated environments
- **30-day validation:** May extend beyond story timeline; document in-progress if needed
- **Documentation accuracy:** All updates must be verified with actual command execution
- **Repeatability:** Validation procedures must be documented for future use
- **Performance:** Benchmark results should match or exceed existing baselines

**Risk Assessment:**

**Primary Risk:** Paper trading validation reveals stability issues or operational gaps

**Root causes:**
- Broker integration bugs surface under long-running validation
- Data provider flakiness causes intermittent failures
- Configuration issues prevent successful validation
- Performance bottlenecks emerge under realistic load
- 30-day validation timeline may exceed story completion window

**Mitigation:**
1. **Incremental validation:**
   - Start with short-duration tests (1 hour, 1 day) before 30-day run
   - Monitor closely during first 3-7 days to catch issues early
   - Document interim results if full 30-day validation cannot complete in story timeline

2. **Fallback scenarios:**
   - If paper trading fails, document root cause and create remediation ticket
   - If uptime < 99.9%, analyze gaps and determine if acceptable with mitigation
   - If validation cannot complete, establish go-live criteria based on interim results

3. **Risk acceptance:**
   - P2 validation issues do not block P0/P1 remediation (security, code quality)
   - Validation provides confidence but is not strict go/no-go gate
   - Business decision may proceed with production deployment with documented risks

4. **Documentation focus:**
   - Even if validation surfaces issues, documentation fixes proceed independently
   - Accurate documentation has value regardless of validation outcomes
   - Troubleshooting guide can capture validation-discovered issues

**Rollback:**
- Documentation changes: `git revert <commit-hash>`
- Validation infrastructure: No rollback needed (read-only operations)
- If validation breaks production: Impossible (validation uses isolated environments)

**Compatibility Verification:**
- No breaking changes to existing APIs (validation only, no code changes)
- Database changes (if any) are additive only (no database changes)
- UI changes follow existing design patterns (no UI changes)
- Performance impact is negligible (validation runs in isolated environment)
- Existing workflows unaffected (validation does not modify production systems)
- Documentation updates clarify existing functionality (no behavioral changes documented)

**Validation Report Structure:**

Create comprehensive validation report in `docs/validation/X2.3-validation-report.md`:

### Testing

**Operational Validation Tests:**

**Broker Connection Tests:**
- Test at least 2 brokers: paper (always), CCXT exchange (testnet)
- Verify authentication, account access, connection stability
- Document connection details, latency, error handling

**Data Provider Tests:**
- Test at least 2 sources: yfinance (primary), CSV/bundle (fallback)
- Verify data quality, schema correctness, historical completeness
- Document data samples, validation results, error rates

**Benchmark Tests:**
- Run backtest benchmark suite with multiple strategies
- Measure execution time, throughput, memory usage
- Compare results to baseline (if available) or establish baseline

**Paper Trading Tests:**
- Run 30-day validation with representative strategy
- Monitor logs for errors, warnings, heartbeat interruptions
- Analyze uptime, error rates, trade execution quality
- Target: ≥99.9% uptime, no critical errors

**Uptime Analysis:**
- Parse logs to calculate uptime metrics
- Identify downtime periods and root causes
- Generate report with KPIs and recommendations

**Documentation Validation Tests:**

**Audit Process:**
1. Extract all CLI command references from docs
2. For each reference:
   - Verify command exists: `python -m rustybt <command> --help`
   - Verify options/flags match documentation
   - Execute example commands to verify accuracy
3. Document discrepancies in validation report

**Fix Verification:**
1. Update documentation with correct references
2. Re-execute examples to verify fixes
3. Commit changes with clear descriptions
4. Peer review documentation updates

**Regression Tests:**

**Operational Commands:**
```bash
# Verify all CLI commands still work
python -m rustybt --help
python -m rustybt test-broker --help
python -m rustybt test-data --help
python -m rustybt benchmark --help
python -m rustybt paper-trade --help
python -m rustybt analyze-uptime --help
# Expected: All commands display help without errors
```

**Documentation Rendering:**
```bash
# Verify docs render correctly (if using doc generator)
mkdocs build  # Or equivalent
# Expected: No warnings, docs build successfully
```

**Definition of Done:**
- Task 0 (CLI Command Verification) completed and documented

### Completion Notes List
- Task 1: All CLI commands verified and documented in cli-commands-inventory.md
- Environment setup complete with validation log directory created
- No blockers identified - all required commands present and functional
- Task 2: BLOCKED - Paper broker not available in test-broker command (only in paper-trade), no broker credentials for full testing. Documented findings in broker-validation-findings.md with detailed instructions for future completion. Skipped to Task 3.
- Task 3: Data provider validation complete. yfinance working successfully (SPY fetched, close=$662.37). Alternative sources tested: ccxt FAILED (async/await error), binance FAILED (not implemented). Only 1 of 2 data sources functional. Issues documented in data-provider-validation-report.md. Proceeded with Task 4.
- Task 4: Benchmark validation complete. All benchmarks executed successfully (Decimal: 4.17ms, Memory RSS: 345.47MB, File I/O: 0.56ms). Baseline saved to benchmark-baseline.json. Performance regression script verified working with 20% threshold. CI job performance.yml confirmed operational. Documented in benchmark-validation-report.md. Skipped Tasks 5-7 (30-day paper trading requirement), proceeded to Task 8.
- Task 5-7: DEFERRED - Paper trading validation requires 30 consecutive days of monitoring (per story AC, explicitly allowed to be incomplete within session). Comprehensive setup instructions and completion procedures documented in comprehensive validation report.
- Task 8-9: Documentation audit complete. Extracted 457 CLI references from all documentation. Found 1 CRITICAL error: deployment-guide.md line 955 used non-existent 'fetch-data' command with invalid options. All commands verified against CLI. Comprehensive discrepancy report created in documentation-audit-report.md. Proceeded with Task 10.
- Task 10: Documentation fixes applied. Fixed deployment-guide.md line 955: changed 'fetch-data' to 'test-data', corrected options (--symbols → --symbol, removed --start). Both commands verified working (AAPL=$247.66, MSFT=$514.05). Changes committed (76a144c). Task 11 skipped (depends on paper trading completion).
- Task 11: DEFERRED - Production workflow documentation updates depend on paper trading results. Instructions provided in comprehensive validation report for completion after 30-day paper trading validates.
- Task 12: Comprehensive validation report created. Documented all 12 tasks (6 completed, 1 blocked, 5 deferred). Provided production readiness assessment, risk analysis, and detailed instructions for completing remaining tasks. Report includes step-by-step paper trading setup guide, monitoring checklist, and follow-up story recommendations.

### Story Summary
